# copycat-project

The purpose of this project was to be able to use what we've learmed so far to make a copy of a website. While doing the project we will learn more and use the skills we have be practicing on in class and at home. Working on this project was a difficult task for me becuase I didn't manage my time well so I wasn't able to get evrythin I needed on time, therefore next time I will make sure to manage my time at a better pace. This project was for us to be able to push ourselves to make a copy of a website to be able to know how it will feel like when working on our year long project and to be fully prepared to get all of it done and to make it easier for us by practcing by working on this copycat project we worked on.
